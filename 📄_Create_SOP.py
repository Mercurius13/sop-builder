I didn‚Äôt have too many friends ‚Äì and so when I was taught programming for the first time in the sixth grade, I found a new thing to focus my ‚Äúnerd energy‚Äù on. It began with a curious intent to understand how I could ‚Äútell‚Äù a computer what to do and so I wrote my first program ‚Äì an algorithm that instructed the computer to generate a sequence of numbers in the Fibonacci series. To you, the reader, this might sound mundane ‚Äì but to me, it was an ‚Äúaha‚Äù moment. I wanted to test the boundaries of what I will into existence and wrote 176 programs between the sixth and tenth grades. Two of my most noteworthy programs from this time were a pac-man style game and a GK quiz I built. With time, my interest in programming grew and so, pursing an engineering degree in Computer Science was a natural choice."

I soon learnt that India has the dubious distinction of recording the greatest number of road accidents annually. The average number of road accidents in the last 5 years has been 4,72,000. The large majority of these occur due to human error ‚Äì things like jumping signals, not adhering to speed limits, and driving under the influence of alcohol. Changing societal behaviour on all these fronts is difficult ‚Äì and so, mass producing driverless cars seems like a promising solution to save human lives. Motivated by a personal loss, my goal thus is to work in the field of AI to make fully autonomous cars a reality."

Two projects worth mentioning are my work on creating a tumor identification software and a robot that could identify structural faults in building. The former of these two was a research project commissioned by a local hospital. They had a large inflow of patients who would regularly do CT scans and MRIs ‚Äì but didn‚Äôt have enough doctors to look at the scans in a timely manner. To solve this problem, I studied existing research done on building such models. I found two models that could be tweaked for this purpose. However, these were general object detection models and so I had to train them on five years‚Äô worth of patient scans. I also had the to optimize the algorithm itself for this use case. Today, this software is used by the hospital ‚Äì and in the last year it has detected the nature and stage of over 2,500 tumors with a 97% accuracy saving crucial time and cost for both the hospital and patients. Seeing the results, my head of department recommended me to the department of building safety in the Mumbai Municipal Corporation (MMC). At the time, the MMC faced a peculiar issue ‚Äì there were several buildings in Mumbai that looked structurally healthy from the outside but were on the brink of collapse. Civil engineers were wary of entering such buildings for inspection owing to the risk. To solve this, I created a robot fitted with a camera on top. Using the camera, the bot would autonomously navigate the interior of the building clicking pictures and would calculate the risk of structural failure by spotting cracks, bulging walls and sagging floors.
